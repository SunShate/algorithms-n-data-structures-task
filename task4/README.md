**Queue**

n bus stations placed in town where N = {1, 2, ..., n}.

R bus trajectories there given with ordered sequences of nearest bus stops while bus is moving in one direction.

M_1 = {I_11, I_12, ..., I_1m1},

M_2 = {I_21, I_22, ..., I_2m2},

...

M_r = {I_r1, I_r2, ..., I_rmr},

where I_jk being natural value.

Write program with given index of bus stops I, J which defines the fastest way of traveling passenger from I to J. Provided that travel time between neighbour bus stops is equal and in 3 times lower changing trajectory time. 

Buses can travel in both directions.
